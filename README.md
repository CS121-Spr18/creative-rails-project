# creativeRailsProject

Contributors: Chen Pekker and Daksha Agarwal

Summary:
News, friends, sports, and stories, at the reach of your fingertips. _Scenes_ allows users to express themselves in the form of short Tweeets through an online profile. Each user can create, edit, and delete their own posts. Users will need to login to make changes to their account with a username and password. Join the online conversation now!

Product users: 
Our intented users are between the ages of 13-35 who are interested in sharing their thoughts with their followers, and be able to keep up to date instantly with the posts from others. 

MVP (essential features):
Our MVP will consist of users being able to create, edit, and delete their own Scenes. The post will be displayed in a chronological feed in descending order.

Functionality: 
As an online user, this application will allow you to share your thoughts instantly with all your followers. We seek to resemble a professional user interface with defined features such as trends and users to follow, as well as the feed. We hope this product will be a unique platform for users to interact from around the world, allowing them to broaden their scope of interactions, knowledge and ideas.

Here are a couple of examples of what creating and editing a post will look like, as well as the main page:

Issues:
The first issue we ran into was that one of the contributors was unable to push code onto their github. We kept getting the following error: "Error Code 403 fatal: HTTP request failed." Despite searching online for a solution and trying several, we couldn't get the error to go away. We used online resources and Prof. Kate's advice to resolve this issue.

Our second issue was finding a proper tutorial. The first two we tried to follow were written by other beginners and resulted in errors when we tried to compile. 

Installation steps:
To install our application, download the entire repo and navigate to it in terminal. Run the command `rails s` to start the server. In your preferred web browser open [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) to access _Scenes_.
